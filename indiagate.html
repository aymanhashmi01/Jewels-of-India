  <h1>India Gate - An Iconic War Memorial</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>India Gate, a monumental war memorial located in the heart of New Delhi, stands as a solemn tribute to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. This iconic landmark holds a special place in India's history, symbolizing the nation's gratitude and remembrance for its brave heroes.</p>

  <h2>History and Significance</h2>
  <p>Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, India Gate was completed in 1931. Originally known as the All India War Memorial, its purpose was to honor the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives while serving in the British Indian Army. The Amar Jawan Jyoti (Eternal Flame) was added later to pay homage to the unknown soldiers who gave their lives in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.</p>

  <h2>Architecture and Design</h2>
  <p>India Gate's architecture draws inspiration from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The monument is a soaring archway standing at a height of 42 meters (138 feet) and is made of sandstone and granite. The names of the soldiers who perished in the wars are inscribed on its walls. Atop the arch, there is an empty canopy or 'chhatri,' signifying the soldier's perpetual absence.</p>
